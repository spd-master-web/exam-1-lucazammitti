You will create a single page layout for the Year of the Water Tiger website. Make a compelling layout, plan for the three hours at your disposal.

Your document should be a **valid HTML5** document with correct indentation that contains a meaningful title, meta description, keywords and author.

The CSS should be written in the style.css document. Use only class names to apply styles (no element or ID selectors). Try to come up with meaningful class names.

If you think some are not needed, don’t use them.
Leave a **comment** in your document why you didn’t need them.

Internal **navigation** should link to the three sections.

Use all included **images** as you see fit.

Things to apply:
- validate your code
- all images need alt attributes
- use floats for at least one image
- use flexbox to display the Lucky list items in a row
- use flexbox and fixed positioning for the navigation
- add the github pages option to your repository and add the link to the description
